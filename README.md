# Out-Of-Order-Distribution
We analyze out-of-distribution detection in Vision Transformers by modeling class-wise latent embeddings and evaluating Mahalanobis distance, softmax confidence, and entropy-based metrics on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and Food-101k to assess robustness under distribution shifts.
